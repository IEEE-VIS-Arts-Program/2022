## Introducing the IEEE VIS 2018 Arts Program

The IEEE VIS 2018 Arts Program, or VISAP’18, showcases innovative artwork and research that explores the exciting and increasingly prominent intersections between art, design, and visualization.
Through a dedicated papers track and an exhibition that runs concurrently with the <a href="http://ieeevis.org" style="white-space: nowrap">IEEE VIS 2018</a> conference, the Arts Program aims to foster new thinking, discussion, and collaboration between artists, designers, technologists, visualization scientists, and others working at the intersection of these fields.

VISAP’18 runs from October 23rd through October 26th during the IEEE VIS 2018 conference in Berlin, Germany. Both the exhibited works and the accepted papers are selected through a rigorous peer review process. Submissions are evaluated on quality and relevance to the IEEE VIS community by a program committee made up of experts in visualization, media arts, and design.
