It is the biggest associated event in the<!-- --> <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome">IEEE VIS conference</a>, and its main goal is to foster new thinking, discussion, and collaboration across and between fields of research and practice.</p><p>VISAP welcomes a wide range of submissions, including interactive artworks, design projects, novel visualization tools and applications, art-science or artist-in-lab projects, critical interpretations and evaluations of data visualizations, and philosophical meditations on the intersections between art and research. These can either be submitted to a paper track, or to an exhibition track (see details below).</p><p>VISAP will take place in hybrid form this year. Accepted works to the paper and exhibition track can be presented either virtually oron in-person.</p><p>Accepted works will be published on the official VISAP website and, the exhibits in a dedicated exhibition catalogue. Papers and pictorials will be indexed in the IEEE Xplore digital library.</p><h2>The theme</h2><p>The theme for VISAP’22 is “mingling spaces”. The theme for VISAP’22 is “mingling spaces”. Since 10 years the VIS Arts Program, and before this the VIS Arts Show represent a mingling space, a space “to bring or mix together or with something else, usually without fundamental loss of identity” [Merriam Webster]. VISAP is a space where those who actively work at the intersection of visualization, the arts and design and those who appreciate and/or are inspired by the results of these works can meet, discuss, and exchange perspectives. However, across all these years, the meaning of “space” in the context of the conference has constantly changed and evolved and with it the form of mingling. VISAP as a mingling space has seen many different locations, themes, people and formats, with the two most recent VISAPs that took place virtually maybe representing the most drastic change to the way in which works were presented and discussed.</p><p>VISAP’22 will be an experiment in that it will not only be a mingling space to appreciate and discuss artistic and design perspectives on visualization, but - leveraging the hybrid format of the program this year - it will be an attempt to allow virtual and physical spaces to mingle; to bridge and link the virtual and the physical, the immaterial and the material; people and artifacts online and offline, remote and on-site.<!-- --> </p><p>As such, we invite submissions that engage with and re-interprete the theme of “mingling spaces” in different ways.<!-- --> </p><ul><li>How have (social) spaces and the ways in which we mingle changed in response to technological, political, and economic factors (e.g., digitization, the rise of social media, the pandemic, the climate crisis, the renaissance of nationalism and right-wing populism, etc…)?</li><li>How is our behaviour, our communication and the ways in which we read and experience each other changed in response to the (digital and physical) spaces in which we interact?</li><li>How does (personal) data and their representation facilitate, change, distort, feeds off and or inhibit the mingling of people and spaces?</li><li>How can our interactions - our mingling - bridge physical, conceptual and ideological boundaries?</li></ul><h2>Submission details</h2><p>Submissions can either be made to:</p><ol><li>A paper track: Extended abstract with an 10 page limit, including figures and references;</li><li>A pictorial track (annotated portfolios): 16 page limit, using the InDesign or Word template specified below.</li><li>An exhibition track: Two-page description of the exhibit, accompanied by any relevant visuals and/or sound files.</li></ol><p>All submissions are due by June 2, 2022<!-- --> <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/time-zones/aoe/#:~:text=The%20current%20time%20and%20date%20right%20now&amp;text=Anywhere%20on%20Earth%20or%20AoE,offset%20of%20%2D%2012%3A00">AOE</a>, using the<!-- --> <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc">Precision Conference System (PCS)</a>.

We encourage all artists and designers to showcase and describe the process of research creation when producing visualizations or data-driven art pieces.</p><p>Accepted submissions to the paper and to the pictorial tracks will be presented during the IEEE VIS conference VISAP sessions. Accepted exhibits will be displayed during the opening reception, and throughout the conference in a dedicated exhibition space.
