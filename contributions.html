As a way of exhibiting them, the tiles are available so the public can interact and rearrange them in their own way. In this manner, participants are invited to form their own paths, imagining and fabulating routes. In addition, through a projection mapped on top of some tiles, it is possible to know more features about the routes: origin and destination, what type of route it is and how the information was obtained.\n\nThe process of capturing the paths was done differently according to the type of path. The red ceramic tiles contain drawings of physical paths that were captured by the cell phone’s GPS during the artist’s walks and movements around the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. On the other hand, the white ceramic tiles contain virtual paths that were traced considering the global information infrastructure networks and the locations where the headquarters of telecommunications and technology companies are based.\n\nWithout any colorant or glaze, the creation of the tiles is based on the use of two types of clay that are originally of different colors. The color of the clay distinguishes for the visitor the real paths from the virtual ones, serving as a key to understand the type of path that is being represented. After the paths were traced onto the clay, the tiles were fired at a high temperature respecting the traditions of pottery.\n\nThe installation is a participatory work of data physicalization that poses questions to the public about our presence in the real and virtual world today.","images":[{"src":"01.jpg","width":5472,"height":3648},{"src":"02.jpg","width":5472,"height":3648},{"src":"03.jpg","width":5472,"height":3648},{"src":"04.jpg","width":5472,"height":3648},{"src":"05.jpg","width":5472,"height":3648}]},{"id":"shifting-winds","pc_id":"1021","title":"Shifting winds: Gendered structures of academic mentorship","authors":[{"id":"A023","name":"Jiabao","surname":"Li","affiliation":"The University of Texas at Austin","website":"https://www.jiabaoli.org/","bio":"Jiabao Li creates works addressing climate change, interspecies world sharing, humane technology, and a just, sustainable future.

Cosmologists say that most of the universe is structured by antimatter. We postulate that social media is similarly structured by effects of the unobserved discourse and experience. The backbone of a movement such as #MeToo is not based on the most-liked and most-retweeted, but by the masses of unobserved tweets. Vast numbers of #MeToo tweets that had no retweets and no likes nonetheless constituted acts of quiet testimony or unassuming solidarity. Conventional measures of network science thus fail to capture the true relevance of #MeToo. As Black feminist Patricia Hill Collins says, \"Most activism is brought about by ordinary people like ourselves.\"\nFrom a distance, the graphics appear as abstract diagrams, similar to Bridget Riley’s work. The beauty of each line contains a powerful request for a reordering of power within society. We present an opportunity to engage with each request—from individual people at individual moments within a collective movement that is not over. #MeToo is urgent, #InvisibleNoMore is urgent, #BelieveBlackWomen is urgent, #MMIWG2S is urgent, #SayHerName is urgent. We are still living in a crisis of sexual violence. So we invite you to ditch the networked metrics and listen.\n\n[pictorial] Situating #MeToo; A constructivist perspective on designing with data. This document introduces the various questions, blockades, and off-center paths encountered in researching and designing a project around tweets with hashtags related to the MeToo Movement. What the paper offers is a perspective on the process of designing with data from a constructivist perspective. Rather than asking what representation fits the data, we reverse the question on two levels. First, the data: We took authorship by selecting the data, and by making choices away from the algorithmic and the superlative. And second on the level of visualization. Rather than finding the right chart type for the data, we ask what we want the data to be imagined as.","images":[{"src":"metoo-first-day-lg.png","width":5000,"height":5004},{"src":"metoo-indigenous-lg.png","width":5000,"height":5004},{"src":"metoo-metoos-lg.png","width":5000,"height":5004},{"src":"metoo-reports-lg.png","width":5000,"height":5004}]},{"id":"essys-sharing-uc","pc_id":"1027","title":"ESSYS* Sharing #UC: An Emotion-driven Audiovisual Installation","authors":[{"id":"A002","name":"Sérgio M.","surname":"Rebelo","affiliation":"University of Coimbra, Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","website":"https://sergiorebelo.work/","bio":"Sérgio M.

This visualization project comes as a celebration of the fringe couples and families who have a multi-racial identity, effectively embodying the intermingling of races, and dissolving the systemic barriers put on their very own existence. According to the census, there are only vestiges of these multi-racial families until 1960. Prior to that, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons, while after 1970 race was reported by someone in the household. In 1967, Loving v. Virginia ended restrictions on multi-racial marriage. Only after 2000 people can identify as being of multiple races. More recently, there has been a surge of multi-racial families in the data, but they are still a rarity, still mere traces of diversity in America. In this visualization you can see every registered multi-racial couple in America, for recent periods in 1-5% samples of the population, and for older periods in 100% samples of the population. Each couple is represented as a colorful chromosome, enabling you to see the races within each family, their ages, sexes, and children. For each year, these couples are organized by rarest multi-racial group first, by ascending average age of the couple, and by number of children. This means that in each group you will first see couples with no children, but as you navigate towards the end a group, you will see couples with more children. In 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ended restrictions on same-sex marriages. Only in recent years you will be able to see same-sex couples. In addition to race, individuals who identify themselves as latino/as are also marked with an L.\n\n","images":[{"src":"image1.png","width":2930,"height":2601},{"src":"image2.png","width":2927,"height":2591},{"src":"image3.png","width":2925,"height":2518}],"video":"video.mp4"},{"id":"at-the-pump","pc_id":"1031","title":"at the pump","authors":[{"id":"A034","name":"Joseph A.","surname":"Insley","affiliation":"Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois, United States Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois, United States","bio":"Joseph A.

While stopped at a gas station one day to fill up my car, I noticed a pair of broken glasses on the ground near the pump, with a rusty paperclip nearby. I found it curious, so I snapped a picture.  The next time I filled up, I saw a battery that had been partially crushed.  I snapped a picture.  I was intrigued by these things that were discarded and left behind.  What was the story behind these items?  Most were likely dropped accidentally. But did their owners know they dropped them, and didn’t bother to pick them up? Or did they get home and wonder, where did I leave my comb? How many other people had walked past them?  Did they even notice them, or give them a second thought? I started to seek them out. I noticed patterns.  I would see similar objects at different gas stations, or the same object at the same station, weeks apart. \n\nThe gas station is a common shared public space that many people move in and out of, often without giving a thought to those that are there before or after them.

Due to the lack of vaccines and cures for the illness, the reaction of various local governments was lockdowns of multiple scales that forced people to stay at home. On social media platforms like Instagram, which offer UI affordances to tag photographs in various places globally, this became impossible for many people due to lockdowns. People in lockdown started to re-appropriate these UI affordances not to locate themselves in a specific place but instead in a fictional place that reflected their condition instead of geographic coordinates. A series of posts tagged in places named “Quarantine” started to appear.\nDue to how the platform is structured, these non-existent places are often associated with real-world coordinates, creating a mingling layer where digital aggregations of data and real-world features meet. After a first mapping that provided an archive of these places directly on Instagram (@quaran.tile), the ephemeral nature of the content on the platform required a physical archival effort to preserve the constructed dataset.\nThis assemblage results in a catalog of places scraped from Instagram as of summer 2020. Various levels of information can describe each place. The first layer is the one available on Instagram: the name is found on the platform, along with latitude and longitude, when available. The address was automatically obtained through reverse geocoding to emphasize the relationship between these digital places and real-world locations.

Due to the impossibility to go out, people started to re-appropriate the geotag affordance to locate themselves in fictional places linked to their condition: posts tagged in places named “Quarantine” started to appear.\n\n[pictorial] QUARANTILES. Archiving expressive digital places from Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the spring of 2020, COVID-19 limited contact between people and prevented from meeting and aggregating in real places. Many had to stay at home, and others spent time in quarantine facilities. In this context, virtual aggregation has increased at the expense\nof in-person aggregation. Expressive geo- tagging, namely the practice of creating locations with fictitious names to express an emotional condition, became worthy of attention. Grounded on anecdotal evidence, fictitious digital locations on social media such as “Quarantine” began to proliferate, which, despite not having a name that could be traced back to an existing place, still carried geo-referenced information with them. Starting from this concept, we present the book Quaran.tiles, an archive of 364 expressive digital places collected from Instagram in April 2020 and enriched with information from Google Street View, which aims to give space and dimension to the resulting collection of fictitious and mingling user-generated places.","images":[{"src":"01.png","width":3300,"height":2400},{"src":"04.png","width":1350,"height":1818},{"src":"02.png","width":3300,"height":2400},{"src":"03.png","width":3300,"height":2400}],"video":"vis22e-sub1041-cam-i16.mp4"},{"id":"the-memory-of-street-hong-kong","pc_id":"1043","title":"The memory of street - Hong Kong: history, culture, memory and post-humanism","authors":[{"id":"A040","name":"Liu","surname":"Chunxi Tracy","affiliation":"City University of Hong Kong, Department of Biomedical Sciences","website":"https://www.tracychunxiliucc.com","bio":"LIU Chunxi Tracy is an artist and biological researcher based in Hong Kong.

Using this approach, we explored and extended the current boundary of cultural concerns of human beings. Human landmarks, such as buildings, streets, and cities, are usually named after famous people, important events, religious symbols, or a piece of collective memories. From Alexandra (named after the Macedonian King) to Hong Kong (meaning “fragrant harbour”), names of places are lyrical codenames that connect human emotions to a physical space. However, while these names last, the stories they tell often get forgotten. In this work, we propose a new, posthuman narrative for naming places. Microorganisms, the invisible lifeforms that pervade every micrometer of air, water bodies, and land on earth, coevolve and interact with the changing environment of the place they inhabit, accumulating genetic traits along the way. Just like gut microbiota that are unique for each individual human, the composition and genetic variations of the microbes in each location are also unique to that place, shaped by millennia of adaptation. Microorganisms narrate another kind of story, told through their genomes, where “collective memories” are a natural history in which anthropological activities play only a small part. Bacteria, the witness of human kings and heroes, wars and revolutions, ascent and extinction, are the rightful “namesake” of places. Using four landmarks in Hong Kong, a city tossed in endless political and cultural tides in the past 150 years, as our point of departure, we contemplated on the use of bacteria as a new narrative for the posthuman stories associated with places. Alongside the philosophical articulations, we also visualized this idea by fabricating an installation through the interdisciplinary use of 3D printing technology and microbiological procedures.","images":[{"src":"01.jpg","width":2902,"height":2190},{"src":"02.jpg","width":2340,"height":1560},{"src":"03.jpg","width":3129,"height":3375},{"src":"04.jpg","width":2417,"height":2350},{"src":"05.jpg","width":4338,"height":3113}]},{"id":"neuroknitting-beethoven","pc_id":"1047","title":"NeuroKnitting Beethoven: visualizing emotional state through the knitting process","authors":[{"id":"A042","name":"Varvara","surname":"Guljajeva","affiliation":"Computational Media and Arts, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","website":"http://var-mar.info/","bio":"Dr Varvara Guljajeva is an Assistant Professor in Computational Media and Arts at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).

It re-visits the composer’s classical compositions from an interdisciplinary viewpoint. The public could experience the musician's (in Seoul, it was a monk's) emotional state, which resulted in the movement of a circular knitting machine installation, visuals, and plotted pattern. The pianist’s affective response to music was captured every second and memorized in the knitted textile pattern, which was sprayed on the yarn before being knitted. High attention level resulted in a dense pattern, and the knitting machine’s speed followed the meditation level. All these processes were real-time and took place simultaneously. Furthermore, the sound-responsive AI-generated visuals were created and displayed alongside the data visualization to accompany brain data visualizations.\nThis artwork demonstrates how an interactive on-stage performance NeuroKnitting Beethoven became a telematic project due to travel restrictions. Thus, EEG data traveled over the distance from a concert hall to the artists’ studio, where was located the knitting machine (Circular Knitic). The knitting process was controlled by real-time biometrical data that was streamed over UDP. In return, the multiple viewpoints of the knitting process were streamed to the concert venue.\nNeuroKnitting Beethoven is an excellent example of how creative technology can save cultural programs and offer novel formats that were initially not planned. As a result, the telematic nature of artwork brings together multiple spaces in a creative and novel way letting the audience experience how brain data can affect physical matter and processes on distance.\nIn short, the artwork explores how a human affective state could influence the mechanical process of knitting and offer a different interpretation of classical music. We translate EEG data to the knitted pattern and the speed of the knitting machine in real-time.","images":[{"src":"image_1.JPG","width":2362,"height":3543},{"src":"image_2_creditsNabiArtCenter.jpg","width":2362,"height":1575},{"src":"image_3_creditsNabiArtCenter.jpg","width":2362,"height":1575},{"src":"image_4.png","width":2953,"height":1726},{"src":"image_5.JPG","width":1535,"height":2303}],"video":"NeuroKnittingBeethoven.mp4"},{"id":"softvoss","pc_id":"1052","title":"SoftVoss","authors":[{"id":"A044","name":"Yin","surname":"Yu","affiliation":"School of Art and Design, San Diego State University, USA","website":"https://yinyudesign.com/","bio":"Dr. Yin Yu is a multidisciplinary artist, designer, and engineer.

Its core technical component is the MCPM algorithm that builds on a computational model of Physarum polycephalum slime mold. Using this methodology, we built the first accurate density map of the cosmic web, detected the contributions of intergalactic medium to the signal from a fast radio burst, explored novel 3D printing designs, developed a physically realistic visualization of volumetric slime mold networks, and explored language embedding models.\n\nSifting Strands presents an interactive performance that transforms the MCPM algorithm to a more expressive formulation that is also music, video, and scene reactive. Our simulation responds to acoustic transients by spatial distortions of the simulation domain, and uses the video and scene geometry capture inputs as additional signaling modalities to steer the virtual agents. The resulting generative patterns have a mesmerizing organic, fractal nature.\n\nWe have performed different adaptations of this work within a series of collaborative art events in Santa Cruz, California titled Liminal Space. In one version, the simulation reacts to the live performed music as well as the video recording of the room and the resulting visuals are projected on the wall. In another, we projected the simulation onto a surfboard which the participants could draw on, creating a feedback loop dialogue between the people and the simulation. In another, we used Microsoft Kinect to detect the motion dynamics of the audience and used that to steer the simulation. For VISAP 2022 we will present an amalgam of these performances.\n\nSifting Strands explores how compter generated art and live audience collaborate in the creative act. People appreciate the opportunity to participate in the performances, whether is be through drawing, modulating and steering the generative system in real time, or simply having stimulating cross-disciplinary conversations. For us researchers this presents a unique opportunity to get feedback and spread knowledge of complex systems through the performances as an outreach activity.\n\nWe believe this work in its own way demonstrates that artistic exploration and scientific research can inform each other, and participatory artistic presentations can make scientific research more accessible and interesting to the general public, with the added benefit of strengthening local art communities.","images":[{"src":"SiftingStrands-0.png","width":1920,"height":1068},{"src":"SiftingStrands-1.png","width":3000,"height":1984},{"src":"SiftingStrands-2.png","width":3500,"height":2436},{"src":"SiftingStrands-3.png","width":2618,"height":1509}],"video":"SiftingStrands-Long.mp4"},{"id":"molecular-planets","pc_id":"1089","title":"Molecular Planets","authors":[{"id":"A013","name":"Christoph","surname":"Müller","affiliation":"Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","bio":"Christoph Müller received his diploma in software engineering from the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

This ongoing motion is the reason that our exhibit is in the form of a mobile – a form of art already used by Alexander Calder, who believed that the mathematical laws of the universe could not be expressed by static art. The idea of mysterious forces holding the universe in balance inspired his mobiles. Likewise, the ever-moving elements of the molecular space is not only invisible, but their shapes are of purely theoretical nature. Visualisation makes the elegance and beauty of the molecular world visible in virtual space by representing molecular models as molecular surfaces portraying the interface between a protein and its environment. Our exhibit not only makes such visualisations transcend into our three-dimensional, tangible space, but also mingles all intermediate mathematical spaces that the idea of molecular surfaces traverse to reach their visual representation into one object.","images":[{"src":"molecular-planets0.png","width":4096,"height":4468},{"src":"molecular-planets1.png","width":4096,"height":4693},{"src":"molecular-planets2.png","width":4096,"height":4573},{"src":"molecular-planets4.png","width":4096,"height":2917}],"video":"a-visap-1089_Müller_Preview.mp4"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/contributions","query":{},"buildId":"i2HGE3Mhog7fNLRco_KDf","assetPrefix":"/2022","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
