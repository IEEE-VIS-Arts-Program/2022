She is currently reaching the final year of her PhD journey at the same institution, and a teaching assistant in the Master degree course.\nHer research and artistic practices focuses on the use of sound as a communication tool, embodying her enthusiasm for musical forms that travel between the fields of Sonification, Sound Design, Human-Computer Interaction and Collaborative and Social Computing. Her PhD theme deals with the proposal and exploration of a systemic structure to conceive a sonification, materialised through an auditory field of sound beings. The main exploration deals with the interaction possibilities with sound forms, and how can they embrace new forms of dialogue that may, ultimately, enhance the emergence of aesthetic experiences that expand new forms of perception.","images":[{"src":"SEICA_MARIANA.jpg","width":2000,"height":2571}],"contributions_ids":1027},{"id":"A004","name":"Pedro","surname":"Martins","affiliation":"CISUC, Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","website":"https://cdv.dei.uc.pt/authors/pedro-martins/","bio":"Pedro Martins holds a PhD degree in Computer Science, and an MSc degree in Informatics and Systems (University of Coimbra).

The installation was presented in an urban art gallery of Círculo de Artes Plásticas de Coimbra during the summer and autumn of 2021. In the installation space, one may see a collection of typographic posters displaying the tweets and listening to an ever-changing ambient sound. The present audiovisuals are created by an autonomous computational creative approach, which employs a neural classifier to recognise the emotional context of a tweet and uses this resulting data as feedstock for the audiovisual generation. The installation’s space was designed to promote an approach and blend between the online and physical perceptions of the same location. We applied multiple experiments with the proposed approach to evaluate the capability and performance. Also, we conduct interview-based evaluation sessions to understand how the installation elements, especially poster designs, are experienced by people regarding diversity, expressiveness and possible employment in other commercial and social scenarios.\n\nhttp://sharing-uc.dei.uc.pt/","images":[{"src":"1.jpeg","width":1372,"height":911},{"src":"2.jpeg","width":4288,"height":2848},{"src":"3.jpeg","width":2568,"height":3866},{"src":"4.jpeg","width":1329,"height":933},{"src":"5.jpeg","width":1329,"height":933}],"video":"video-low-res.mp4"}},"__N_SSG":true}
