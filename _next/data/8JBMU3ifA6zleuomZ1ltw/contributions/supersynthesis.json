It goes over the design decisions behind the sculptural form and software architecture, which collects the data from users through an interactive interface and realizes it through the installation. In the discussion, I bring up previous works that align with this project. I propose the term “communal computing” as a technique used by these works, which create a space for collective interaction and contribute to a social experience using data-driven interactive interfaces and cloud architecture.","images":[{"src":"1.jpg","width":5807,"height":3871},{"src":"2.jpg","width":5665,"height":3777},{"src":"3.jpg","width":6000,"height":4000},{"src":"4.jpg","width":5674,"height":3783},{"src":"5.jpg","width":5941,"height":3961}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
