For 10 years the VIS Arts Program, and before this the VIS Arts Show, have represented a mingling space, a space \u201cto bring or mix together or with something else, usually without fundamental loss of identity\u201d [Merriam-Webster]. VISAP is a mingling space where those who actively work at the intersection of visualization, the arts and design and those who appreciate and/or are inspired by the results of these works can meet, discuss, and exchange perspectives. However, across all these years, the meaning of \u201cspace\u201d in the context of the conference has constantly changed and evolved and with it the form of mingling.

And how has this changed the concept of space? How has our behaviour, our communication, and the ways in which we read and experience each other changed in response to the digital and physical spaces in which we mingle?
