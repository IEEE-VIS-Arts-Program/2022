        <h2>Procedure</h2>

        <p>
            VISAP uses a single-blind review process: submitted material is not required to be anonymized.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            All submissions must be made using the <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc" target="_blank" title="go to IEEE VGTC electronic conference system">IEEE VGTC Electronic Conference System.</a> After creating an account or signing in, submitters will find the VISAP'21 Papers and Exhibition submissions by 1) clicking on the "Submissions" tab, 2) selecting the VIS 2021 conference, and 3) selecting "VIS 2021 VIS Arts Program (VISAP'21)," and finally clicking on "Go." The submission system opens in April.
        </p>

        <p>
            At least one author per accepted paper is required to attend the IEEE VIS conference to present the work. Submitters of accepted artworks are also strongly encouraged to attend the conference to set up their work for the opening reception, and to participate in the program throughout the week.
        </p>

        <p>
            No artist fee is provided. There are some complimentary day registrations available for selected artists. Priority will be given to exhibiting artists. We invite students to apply to the IEEE VIS student volunteer program to help cover registration fees.

        </p>
        <h3>Acceptance</h3>
        <p>
            Accepted authors will present their work in one of the two VISAP Papers sessions during the conference. All accepted papers will be published online in the IEEE VIS 2021 Arts Program proceedings, and indexed in the IEEE Xplore digital library.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="content top-border" id="pictorial-instructions">
        <h2>Pictorials Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            We invite artists and designers to submit pictorials and annotated portfolios related to the theme (dis)connected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Artists, designers, and researchers all make creative choices based on practical knowledge, generally acquired through experience. Unfortunately, this knowledge is seldom shared in publications. VISAP Pictorials aim to foster discussions around this reflection-in-action when creating visualizations or data-driven art pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            These submissions reflect either on shared concepts among a selection of visualizations, or on the design process of a single work. Whether in the case of a single artifact, or in the case of a series of artifacts, the designer is in a unique position to provide valuable insights into the design intentions, the design space explorations, and the design process (LÃ¶wgren 2013). Through pictorials and annotated portfolios, submitters are invited to communicate their visualization practices in rich, heavily visual ways.
        </p>

        <h3>What to Consider</h3>
        <p>
            Elements that reviewers will look for include:
        <ul>
            <li>The appropriateness and richness of the visual style.</li>
            <li>The quality of presentation.</li>
            <li>The production value of images, photos and diagrams.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Example Topics</h3>
        <p>Projects could involve any of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>visualization that emphasizes aesthetics</li>
            <li>visualization that encourages creative interaction</li>
            <li>speculative visualizations</li>
            <li>visualization as tactical media</li>
            <li>new data paradigms</li>
            <li>live coding and streaming data</li>
            <li>complex systems</li>
            <li>exploratory data semantics</li>
            <li>3D visualization, VR environments, and immersive analytics</li>
            <li>computational photography</li>
            <li>ambient information displays</li>
            <li>visualization as storytelling</li>
            <li>design studies</li>
            <li>data sonification</li>
            <li>conversation theory</li>
            <li>digital humanities visualization</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What we mean by Pictorial and Annotated Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            A pictorial is a visual description and reflection of the design process of a single visualization project. It is intended to capture the situated and rich nature of design. See <a href="https://dis.acm.org/2020/pictorials.html" target="_blank">DIS Pictorials</a> for inspiration.
        </p>

        <p>
            An annotated portfolio is a collection of design works with brief textual annotations. It has been proposed by Gaver and Bowers (2012) as a "way to communicate design research." The systematic selection and annotation of the artifacts are part of the contribution. Submitters are encouraged to highlight important features, discuss how ideas were developed, and reflect on recurring topics through their series of works.
        </p>

        <p>
        All accepted work will be included in the online proceedings of VISAP on the visap.net website, as well as in e-catalog that will be shared on the visap website. In addition to accepting installations that may be featured on the online exhibition, some artworks may be selected for artist talks during the week of the IEEE VIS conference. Performance submissions may also be scheduled for specific times during the exhibition. Artists will work with VISAP organizers on details for showcasing their artworks in the online exhibition. Artists and authors are strongly encouraged to participate in the VISAP program throughout the week.
