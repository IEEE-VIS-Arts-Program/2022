Cacophonic Choir is composed of multiple agents distributed in space that each tell a story. From afar, their utterances are heard as an incoherent cloud of murmurs. As the visitor approaches an agent it responds responds by becoming more visually bright, semantically coherent, and sonically clear, thereby revealing the original anonymous testimony of a sexual assault survivor.  The work employs several digital media techniques, including machine learning, physical computing, digital audio signal processing, and digital design and fabrication. Using sonification as storytelling to explore the testimonials, the text changes the way that visitors interact with the data while also expressing the experience of a survivor inundated by media reports.

Inspired by Cangjie, an ancient Chinese legendary historian (c.2650 BCE), invented Chinese characters based on the characteristics of everything on the earth, we trained a neural network that we call Cangjie, to learn the constructions and principles of all the Chinese characters. It perceives the surroundings and transforms it into a collage of unique symbols made of Chinese strokes. The symbols produced through the lens of Cangjie, tangled with the imagery captured by the camera are visualized algorithmically as abstract pixelated semiotics, continuously evolving and compositing

A visualization of the past 150 years in climate data, the piece blurs the lines between sculpture and performance, object and action. With distance from the center representing global average temperature, and time a month by month spiral from bottom to top, the trends present in the form are urgent, alarming, and unmistakable. It is the decision to render the form in a temperature sensitive material, however, that firmly grounds the piece in the present moment. As the piece is experienced, the presence of the viewer causes a color-change from purple to pink, echoing on a local scale the role the viewer is playing in the ecosystems driving the source data at a global scale.",

It consists of Diebold Accuvote voting booths, iMacs, iPads, and small speakers. A custom Max MSP Jitter patch makes it possible for participants to remix videos from political rallies, debates, and news in a structured sixteen beat loop. The video clips sample parts of words in order to build percussion tracks, resulting in a breakdown of language. The touchscreen design is a parody of the touchscreen system employed by the Diebold Accuvote, a voting system that is difficult to audit and susceptible to hacking. The parody continues into the format of the installation itself which will resemble a polling station. The interactive graphic user interface is also a reference to musical devices such as the Roland TR 808 and other drum-machines and electronic musical instruments.",

The aim of this visualization is to give visibility to these highly personal testimonials in a way that is both sensitive and empowering. With our visualization we aim to raise empathy and reflection on this and related ongoing issues in Academia. Influenced by the feelings of reading the aforementioned stories, we designed and implemented a custom visual model that depicts individual voices as knots of text shaped based on the content and character of testimonials. To have a knot in the stomach is indeed a colloquialism used to depict disheartening feelings that also appears in the survey. Our project is built around this visual metaphor, used to connect the visual display of data with the feelings of the people behind it.",

The piece is composed of three intertwined elements: surveillance camera footage, stories generated by artificial intelligence, and headshot footage of silhouettes of Asian people. The pandemic is amplifying our exposure and engagement with social media and bombarding us with video and images from mobile phones. Incidences of racism and xenophobia - reinforced by the political narrative around the origins of COVID-19 - are spilling into the streets to be captured by the ubiquity of cameras. The intersection of AI, surveillance footage, and human performers is an investigation into complex systems, streaming data, and visualization as storytelling.

Uncertain Facing visualizes the real-time clustering of fake faces in 3D space through t-SNE, a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, with face embeddings of the faces. However, unlike the original purpose of t-SNE that is for objective data exploration, it represents data points as metaballs making two or more faces a merged face when they are close, to reflect the uncertain, probabilistic nature of data locations the algorithm yields. Uncertain Facing also sonifies the change of the overall data distribution in 3D space. Uncertain Facing allows the audience to take a picture of their face as new data and to find their face being merged with similar fake faces, raising concerns about the unintended use of ML with synthetic/fake data.",
