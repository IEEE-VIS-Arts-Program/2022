Cosmologists say that most of the universe is structured by antimatter. We postulate that social media is similarly structured by effects of the unobserved discourse and experience. The backbone of a movement such as #MeToo is not based on the most-liked and most-retweeted, but by the masses of unobserved tweets. Vast numbers of #MeToo tweets that had no retweets and no likes nonetheless constituted acts of quiet testimony or unassuming solidarity. Conventional measures of network science thus fail to capture the true relevance of #MeToo. As Black feminist Patricia Hill Collins says, &quot;Most activism is brought about by ordinary people like ourselves.&quot;
From a distance, the graphics appear as abstract diagrams, similar to Bridget Riley’s work. The beauty of each line contains a powerful request for a reordering of power within society. We present an opportunity to engage with each request—from individual people at individual moments within a collective movement that is not over. #MeToo is urgent, #InvisibleNoMore is urgent, #BelieveBlackWomen is urgent, #MMIWG2S is urgent, #SayHerName is urgent. We are still living in a crisis of sexual violence. So we invite you to ditch the networked metrics and listen.

[pictorial] Situating #MeToo; A constructivist perspective on designing with data. This document introduces the various questions, blockades, and off-center paths encountered in researching and designing a project around tweets with hashtags related to the MeToo Movement. What the paper offers is a perspective on the process of designing with data from a constructivist perspective. Rather than asking what representation fits the data, we reverse the question on two levels. First, the data: We took authorship by selecting the data, and by making choices away from the algorithmic and the superlative. And second on the level of visualization. Rather than finding the right chart type for the data, we ask what we want the data to be imagined as.</p></div><div class="col-xl-8 col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-sm-12 offset-xl-2 offset-lg-2 offset-md-1 offset-sm-0"><h5>Artist<!-- -->s<!-- --> bio</h5></div><div class="col-md-10 col-sm-12 offset-md-1 offset-sm-0"><div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5 row"><div class="col-sm-2"><div class="" style="max-width:30vw"></div></div><div class="col-sm-7"><p class="mt-0 mb-0 fw-semibold"><a class="contributions_authorLink__jWzM6" href="https://kimalbrecht.com">Kim<!-- --> <!-- -->Albrecht</a></p><p class="contributions_bio__qi_Pb mb-0">Kim Albrecht visualizes cultural, technological, and scientific forms of knowledge.
