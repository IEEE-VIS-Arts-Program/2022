This ongoing motion is the reason that our exhibit is in the form of a mobile – a form of art already used by Alexander Calder, who believed that the mathematical laws of the universe could not be expressed by static art. The idea of mysterious forces holding the universe in balance inspired his mobiles. Likewise, the ever-moving elements of the molecular space is not only invisible, but their shapes are of purely theoretical nature. Visualisation makes the elegance and beauty of the molecular world visible in virtual space by representing molecular models as molecular surfaces portraying the interface between a protein and its environment. Our exhibit not only makes such visualisations transcend into our three-dimensional, tangible space, but also mingles all intermediate mathematical spaces that the idea of molecular surfaces traverse to reach their visual representation into one object.</p></div><div class="col-xl-8 col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-sm-12 offset-xl-2 offset-lg-2 offset-md-1 offset-sm-0"><h5>Artist<!-- -->s<!-- --> bio</h5></div><div class="col-md-10 col-sm-12 offset-md-1 offset-sm-0"><div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5 row"><div class="col-sm-2"><div class="" style="max-width:30vw"></div></div><div class="col-sm-7"><p class="mt-0 mb-0 fw-semibold"><a class="contributions_authorLink__jWzM6">Christoph<!-- --> <!-- -->Müller</a></p><p class="contributions_bio__qi_Pb mb-0">Christoph Müller received his diploma in software engineering from the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
