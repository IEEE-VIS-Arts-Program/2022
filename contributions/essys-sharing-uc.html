Her research and artistic practices focuses on the use of sound as a communication tool, embodying her enthusiasm for musical forms that travel between the fields of Sonification, Sound Design, Human-Computer Interaction and Collaborative and Social Computing. Her PhD theme deals with the proposal and exploration of a systemic structure to conceive a sonification, materialised through an auditory field of sound beings. The main exploration deals with the interaction possibilities with sound forms, and how can they embrace new forms of dialogue that may, ultimately, enhance the emergence of aesthetic experiences that expand new forms of perception.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-md-10 col-sm-12 offset-md-3 offset-sm-0"><div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5 row"><div class="col-sm-2"><div class="" style="max-width:30vw"></div></div><div class="col-sm-7"><p class="mt-0 mb-0 fw-semibold"><a class="contributions_authorLink__jWzM6" href="https://cdv.dei.uc.pt/authors/pedro-martins/">Pedro<!-- --> <!-- -->Martins</a></p><p class="contributions_bio__qi_Pb mb-0">Pedro Martins holds a PhD degree in Computer Science, and an MSc degree in Informatics and Systems (University of Coimbra).
